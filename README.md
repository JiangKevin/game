This is a repository of a future game and game engine. It will use only open technologies and will be multiplatform.
Sometime in the distant future (1-2 years) shall go private when progress starts to speed up and a demo takes shape.

Use the ```r``` python 3 script in the root of the repository to build the project (it has help).
