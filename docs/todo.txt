== questions:

== bugs:
gcc cannot build shaders - it hangs (also ruins the .bin files themselves)
CI - travis builds fail because of submodule issues...?
CI - appveyor emscripten build fails for some reason

== engine:
- on floating point:
    - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/e9b52ceh(v=vs.110).aspx
    - http://yosefk.com/blog/consistency-how-to-defeat-the-purpose-of-ieee-floating-point.html

== build system:
- remove as much as possible from emscripten build (like doctest for example)
- shared precompiled headers for plugins...?
- make a proper release config - with LTO, no plugins, etc.
- be able to build everything in release except for gameplay code (debug iterators?)
- faster vcvarsall.bat - just setup the paths on my own - http://www.randygaul.net/2016/06/03/faster-vcvars32-bat/
- unity builds
- consider including parts of glm as needed and not the entire thing - also read the manual again
questionable:
- ability to have only the game code in the solution - no third parties
- test all headers option for build system (that makes a dummy cpp for each header and just includes it to see if headers are stand-alone) - https://github.com/ldionne/dyno/blob/master/cmake/TestHeaders.cmake
- optimizations for GLM (and STL and others) even in debug builds... #pragma GCC push_options #pragma GCC optimize("O2") ...

== assets:
- https://github.com/tlorach/Bak3d

== codegen:
- syntax highlighting for .mix files in VS
- hashing - use hash_append from github (not ported to MSVC yet) - or roll my own...
- look into https://github.com/macton/DDLParser

== random:
- filesystem watcher for added files - touches root cmake file (in python)
- decouple rendering/logic in separate threads
- mark a function to be without optimizations - __attribute__((optnone)) / __attribute__((optimize("O0"))) / #pragma optimize("", off)

== graphics:
https://github.com/andr3wmac/lightmapper_bgfx
shader compiler
    should probably have a committed binary from a release build which to use
    write my own cmake
    build a shader with different defines

== logging:

== coding standard:
- figure it out
- get into the habit of declaring every constructor explicit - https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/more-than-you-need/
- prefer explicit casts (for example !! is bad - do a static_cast<bool>)
- use the keywords form <ciso646>
- make a linter rule against "!" - better make the expression explicit! or use "not"
- use the prefix increment operators instead of postfix - http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0093/

== plugin hot swap system:
- hit 1 button and have the game rebuild and reload what is necessary while debugger is attached
- optional on demand reloading - instead of automatic polling
- background compiler process
- catching SEH exceptions and crashes - and temporarily stop calling the 'update' method of objects of that type
- serialization and field mapping to be only by name and not type - so a float could go to a double
- undo system - by keeping a copy of a last working .dll version of a plugin (one which hasn't crashed during it's update())

== random notes:
- if emscripten problem with unregistered mixins comes up again:
    //if(_dynamix_get_mixin_type_info((MIXIN_TYPE*)nullptr).id == dynamix::INVALID_MIXIN_ID)
    //    dynamix::internal::domain::safe_instance().register_mixin_type<MIXIN_TYPE>(
    //            _dynamix_get_mixin_type_info((MIXIN_TYPE*)nullptr));

== dynamix:
- make dynamix::object extentable - by inheriting from user types
    - see the "extend_object" branch in my fork of dynamix...
    - alternatively just inherit from it and use the resulting type
- forward declaring messages - for better link times - or maybe not - might lead to slower messages
- currently sizeof(dynamix::object) == 4 * sizeof(void*) - if default message implementations are dropped it can become 2 pointers
- ability to put messages in namespaces
    - easiest with alternative macros with an additional parameter - the namespace
    - maybe with some hacky preprocessor magic - defining namespaces and undefining them around message declarations/definitions
- moving stuff like this back into the header so it can get inlined with optimizations:
    https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/blob/4fa52dda8205680dfa90c671674f980bbf492e16/src/mixin_collection.cpp#L30
    or maybe just when my project is big enough - move lots of dynamix stuff into the headers and profile...
