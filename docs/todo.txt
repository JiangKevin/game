think about sub-field handling - "t.pos" instead of just "t" - this will allow for using imgui bindings for composite types

editor:
    parental
        grouping
        inheriting transformations
        when ONLY parental information changes - transforms should change accordingly so no object moves in the visual world
        perhaps move out of a mixin and into the object class?
        detecting cycles ???
    duplicate objects
    prefabs
        field/mixin annotations for being skipped from prefabs
        single object templates
        groups of object templates - group template
    save/load
    flags
        no_gizmo
    focus
    switching states between editing and gameplay
    camera
        maya-like - with the same move/pan controls
    force uniqueness of object names
    IDs
    GUI
        dragging objects in the scene explorer - also editing parental information
        setting attributes explicitly - separately from the serialize() functionality of the whole mixins
        add/remove mixins to/from objects
    picking
        raycast
        rectangle selection
    rendering
        - make gizmos draw last - on top of the objects in the scene (but with depth test enabled for themselves!)
    curve editing
    bugs
        dependent components - ordered creation... currently the camera mixin calls messages in its ctor
            resolution: forbid the calling of messages in constructors and move widely used fields to the object itself!
    postponed
        - copy/paste of objects
        - gizmos - rotation around pivot different from the object center
        - gizmos - local space (also supported by tiny-gizmo) - test it/think about it
        - object transform snapping (also with gizmos)
        - editing an attribute of multiple objects at once
        - command script for editing the level
        - resource viewer - all resources with preview when appropriate and refcounts
        - undo/redo
            mutating objects - serialization/deserialization only for the relevant mixins - currently done for all...

ditch bgfx
ditch glfw in favor of sdl

== questions:
const-correctness around the oid and Object classes
not having the entire simulation state in clients - to prevent cheating?
can the state between clients be really the same? indexes in resource managers and allocators and the like...?
move to RH coordinate system with Z+ up? Tuti put some good arguments forward - also the GLTF 2.0 format assumes right handed
figure out a coding standard

== bugs:
CI - appveyor emscripten build fails for some reason

== to test:
- aabb class

== build system:
to think about:
    - link to third parties dynamically when possible
    - remove as much as possible from emscripten build (doctest, imgui demo)
    - shared precompiled headers for plugins...?
    - make a proper release config - with LTO, no plugins, etc.
    - be able to build everything in release except for gameplay code (debug iterators?)
    - faster vcvarsall.bat - just setup the paths on my own - http://www.randygaul.net/2016/06/03/faster-vcvars32-bat/
    - ninja instead of msbuild - see this: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/08/14/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-customizing-your-environment/
    - unity builds
    - optimizations for STL and others even in debug builds... #pragma GCC push_options #pragma GCC optimize("O2") ...
questionable:
    - test all headers option for build system (that makes a dummy cpp for each header and just includes it to see if headers are stand-alone) - https://github.com/ldionne/dyno/blob/master/cmake/TestHeaders.cmake

== plugin hot swap system:
- hit 1 button and have the game rebuild and reload what is necessary while debugger is attached
- optional on demand reloading - instead of automatic polling
- background compiler process
- catching SEH exceptions and crashes - and temporarily stop calling the 'update' method of objects of that type
- undo system - by keeping a copy of a last working .dll version of a plugin (one which hasn't crashed during it's update())

== codegen:
- type parser
    - support for nested types
    - support for types in namespaces
    - error checking
    - ability to parse fields without needing FIELD at the start - hard because of inline methods...
        - or find a way to use magic_get with classes with private fields to compare against the count of FIELD
            - see this: https://github.com/apolukhin/magic_get/issues/10
        - or use real parsing and compare results - python cppheaderparser?
- hashing - use hash_append from github (not ported to MSVC yet) - or roll my own...

== coding standard:
- all custom types should begin with a capital letter!
- prefix with _ all function arguments?
- always call messages with :: prefix if they are in the global scope - to not accidentally call something else
- get into the habit of declaring every constructor explicit - https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/more-than-you-need/
- prefer explicit casts (for example !! is bad - do a static_cast<bool>)
- use the keywords form <ciso646>
- make a linter rule against "!" - better make the expression explicit! or use "not"
- use the prefix increment operators instead of postfix - http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0093/

== random notes:
- if emscripten problem with unregistered mixins comes up again:
    //if(_dynamix_get_mixin_type_info((MIXIN_TYPE*)nullptr).id == dynamix::INVALID_MIXIN_ID)
    //    dynamix::internal::domain::safe_instance().register_mixin_type<MIXIN_TYPE>(
    //            _dynamix_get_mixin_type_info((MIXIN_TYPE*)nullptr));

== dynamix:
wanted:
    - reworked allocators - mainly the ability to know for which object the mixin is being allocated for
    - add has/get methods to object class that work with C strings (and mixin_id) and not just template parameters
    - add ability to check if object implements a bunch of messages: #define interface team_msg & name_msg & hp_msg
optimization:
    - currently sizeof(dynamix::object) == 4 * sizeof(void*) - if default message impls are dropped it can become 2 pointers
    - object::get_mixin_names() - do a .reserve() before the push_back-s
    - moving stuff like this back into the header so it can get inlined with optimizations:
        https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/blob/4fa52dda8205680dfa90c671674f980bbf492e16/src/mixin_collection.cpp#L30
        or maybe just when my project is big enough - move lots of dynamix stuff into the headers and profile...
        even checking if a mixin is implemented has no chance of getting inlined! :(
    - forward declaring messages - for better link times - or maybe not - might lead to slower messages
hygiene:
    - prefix everything after _dynamix_internal: with "internal"
